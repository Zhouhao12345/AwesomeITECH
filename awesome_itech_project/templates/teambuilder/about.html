                    The university has many group projects. However some students are faced with difficulties finding
                    team members when it is required for them to execute projects in a team, Some teams may have incomplete members, and some
                    teams end up having a member that may not contribute much towards the success of the project due to lack of required skills.
                    </p>

                    Our webapp aims to link teams requiring member(s) and students requiring teams together. A student can make a request for
                    members to complete his or her team and also can respond to an existing request for team members, indicating interest in
                    joining the team.
