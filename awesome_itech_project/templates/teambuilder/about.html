            Our university have many group projects. However some students are faced with difficulties finding team members when it is required for them to execute projects in a team, Some teams may have incomplete members, and some teams end up having a member that may not contribute much towards the success of the project due to lack of required skills
            </p>

            Our website aims to link teams requiring member(s) and students requiring teams togetherm. A student can make a request for members to complete his or her team and also can respond to an existing request for team members, indicating interest in joining the team
